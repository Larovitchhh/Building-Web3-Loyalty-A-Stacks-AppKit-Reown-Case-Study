4. Frontend Integration with Reown AppKit
For a seamless user experience, your dApp's frontend, powered by Reown AppKit, would interact with this contract as follows:

Connect Wallet: Use Reown to connect the user's Stacks wallet (e.g., Leather, Xverse).

Display Donation Progress: Upon connection, call get-total with the user's principal to display their current STX contributions. This can fuel a dynamic progress bar.

Enable Donation: Provide a UI element (e.g., a button) that calls the donate function, allowing users to contribute STX.

NFT Claim UI: Offer a "Claim NFT" button. In a production scenario, this button would only activate once the get-total value exceeds the VIP threshold. For testing, it demonstrates the direct minting capability.

Post-Minting Feedback: After claim-membership is successful, update the UI to show the user's newly acquired NFT, potentially linking to its metadata or a gallery.
