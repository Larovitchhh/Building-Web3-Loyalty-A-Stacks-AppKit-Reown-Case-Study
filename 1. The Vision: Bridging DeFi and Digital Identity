1. The Vision: Bridging DeFi and Digital Identity
Our goal was to transcend a simple tipping mechanism into a powerful Web3 loyalty program. The core idea was to allow users to become "Founding Members" of a dApp by contributing STX, and in return, claim an exclusive Non-Fungible Token (NFT) as their digital badge of honor. This approach fosters community, provides tangible rewards, and leverages the transparency of the blockchain to verify membership status.
